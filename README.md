<h1>ESP32_Utilize_Both_Cores</h1>
<h3>About this project</h3>
<i>Not a project actually...</i><br>
<p>The ESP32 is an affordable <b>Dual-Core</b>, 32bit microcontroller that can be programmed through the Arduino framework. By default, <b>the Arduino framework runs the code on core 1</b> and as a result, the <b>second core</b> (core 0) remains <b>unutilized</b>. In order to use the second core, a task must be created explicitly that will bind a function to core 0. This function can then be constructed appropriately to simulate the loop() function. This project accomplishes just that, it integrates two loop() functions that each runs on a seperate core.</p>
